## Info
This CraftBukkit/Spigot plugin aims to offer a simple server password which is the same for _all_ users.

**THIS IS NOT A PLUGIN FOR A USER SPECIFIC PASSWORD**

Without logging in the user is jailed in a pre defined cuboid and ported back once he leaves the jail area.
You can define jail areas for each world and configure which actions like block breaking, chatting or flying should be disabled.
There is an additional ability to allow certain commands or to auto-kick or auto-ban a user after X failed attempts.

**Features**
* Cancel different interaction events like
  * Pickup items
  * Drop items
  * Break blocks
  * Hit mobs or players
  * Chat
  * Triggering of mobs
  * Interaction with items
  * Using a portal
  * Drops on death
  * Flying
* Auto kick and auto ban (even the IP) after configurable amount of tries
* Blindness and slowness for the player
* Jail area - the player is teleported back if he leaves the area - can be turned off with disableJailArea
* Per world jail area!
* **Hashing (one way!)** of password, choose between **SHA, SHA-256, SHA-512, MD5 & more**
* Custom commands are allowed to execute (like /rules)
* Teleport the player back to the previous location (location on logout)

*Third party features, all of them can be disabled*
* Metrics for usage statistics
